## Readme

This web app is developed to simplify the binance websocket stream testing process. By utilizing the interface, the user can check on multiple streams at a time without knowing the parameters. Since this app is designed for testing purpose instead of the real subscription tool, ***all the subscribed streams will be unsubscribed in 2 sec.***
